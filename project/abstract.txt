So through this web application, students and lecturers benefit a lot and can conduct hassle free online classes and teachers can focus on delivering the classes.It increases student’s learning efficiency

	During the class, automatic attendance will be posted to the teachers for their respective classes. 
	Bandwidth optimization
	Summary and Report for each class and can be referred by the student at any time and much more efficient than watching a recorded session.

Students who miss their classes can see the reports/summary related to the classes conducted on a particular day and can learn easily. Teachers can login through, create links for their respective classes and share it with their students. Students can join the class with their respective institution mail ids provided. During the class, automatic attendance will be posted to the teachers for their respective classes.
